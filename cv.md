### About Me
My name is Victoria Ryzhkova. I am 26 years old. I have two higher educations in the specialties "finance and credit" (qualification - economist) and "examination of consumer goods" (qualification - commodity expert).

Work experience as a seller, cashier-operator in a bank, assistant accountant ( experience with 1C, document management), logistics manager (experience in the CRM program, etc.), customer service manager in social networks. Extensive experience in communicating with people. I know how to set and achieve my goals. I quickly learn everything new, I am not conflicted, polite and stress-resistant, I know how to work in a team.

I know English at an pre-intermediate level (B1 in the active process).

Since 2020, I started studying programming, I was very interested in it.
I have successfully completed 3 courses at the HTML Academy - "HTML and CSS. Professional Coding of websites", "Adaptive Coding and automation of websites", "JavaScript, Professional development of web interfaces".

I also created about 15 training projects on GitHub together with Glo Academy, where I repeated the code on online broadcasts and did my own coding homework. 

I watched CS50 courses on YouTube, took an introduction to programming course on hexlet and I study something new every day.

I really like programming, because every day you learn something new, create cool and useful things with your own hands.
In the future, I would like to become a Senior Frontend Developer, work in a large company with motivated and intelligent people, which helps people and their business achieve their goals, develop their companies and become better every day.
